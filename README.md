# automl-gs

![console gif](docs/console-demo.gif)

Give an input CSV file and a target field you want to predict to automl-gs, and get a trained high-performing machine learning or deep learning model plus native Python code pipelines allowing you to integrate that model into any prediction workflow. No black box: you can see *exactly* how the data is processed, how the model is constructed, and you can make tweaks as necessary.

automl-gs is an AutoML tool which, unlike Microsoft's [NNI](https://github.com/Microsoft/nni), Uber's [Ludwig](https://github.com/uber/ludwig), and [TPOT](https://github.com/EpistasisLab/tpot), offers a *zero code/model definition interface* to getting an optimized model and data transformation pipeline in multiple popular ML/DL frameworks, with minimal Python dependencies (pandas + scikit-learn + your framework of choice). automl-gs is designed for citizen data scientists and engineers without a deep statistical background under the philosophy that you don't need to know any modern data preprocessing and machine learning engineering techniques to create a powerful prediction workflow.

Nowadays, the cost of computing many different models and hyperparameters is much lower than the opportunity cost of an data scientist's time. automl-gs is a Python 3 module designed to abstract away the common approaches to transforming tabular data, architecting machine learning/deep learning models, and performing random hyperparameter searches to identify the best-performing model. This allows data scientists and researchers to better utilize their time on model performance optimization.

* Generates native Python code; no platform lock-in, and no need to use automl-gs after the model script is created.
* Train model configurations super-fast *for free* using a **TPU** and TensorFlow in Google Colaboratory. (in Beta: you can access the Colaboratory notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sbF8cqnOsdzN9Bdt74eER5s_xXcdvatV)).
* Handles messy datasets that normally require manual intervention, such as datetime/categorical encoding and spaced/parenthesized column names.
* Each part of the generated model pipeline is its own function w/ docstrings, making it much easier to integrate into production workflows.
* Extremely detailed metrics reporting for every trial stored in a tidy CSV, allowing you to identify and visualize model strengths and weaknesses.
* Correct serialization of data pipeline encoders on disk (i.e. no pickled Python objects!)
* Retrain the generated model on new data without making any code/pipeline changes.
* Quit the hyperparameter search at any time, as the results are saved after each trial.
* Training progress bars with ETAs for both the overall experiment and per-epoch during the experiment.

The models generated by automl-gs are intended to give a very strong *baseline* for solving a given problem; they're not the end-all-be-all that often accompanies the AutoML hype, but the resulting code is easily tweakable to improve from the baseline.

You can view the hyperparameters and their values [here](automl_gs/hyperparameters.yml), and the metrics that can be optimized [here](automl_gs/metrics.yml). Some of the more controversial design decisions for the generated models are noted in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## Framework Support

Currently automl-gs supports the generation of models for regression and classification problems using the following Python frameworks:

* TensorFlow (via `tf.keras`) | `tensorflow`
* XGBoost (w/ histogram binning) | `xgboost`

To be implemented:

* Catboost | `catboost`
* LightGBM | `lightgbm`

## How to Use

automl-gs can be installed [via pip](https://pypi.org/project/automl_gs/):

```shell
pip3 install automl_gs
```

You will also need to install the corresponding ML/DL framework (e.g. `tensorflow`/`tensorflow-gpu` for TensorFlow, `xgboost` for xgboost, etc.)

After that, you can run it directly from the command line. For example, with the [famous Titanic dataset](http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs109/cs109.1166/problem12.html):

```shell
automl_gs titanic.csv Survived
```

If you want to use a different framework or configure the training, you can do it with flags:

```shell
automl_gs titanic.csv Survived --framework xgboost --num_trials 1000
```

You may also invoke automl-gs directly from Python. (e.g. via a Jupyter Notebook)

```python
from automl_gs import automl_grid_search

automl_grid_search('titanic.csv', 'Survived')
```

The output of the automl-gs training is:

* A timestamped folder (e.g. `automl_tensorflow_20190317_020434`) with contains:
  * `model.py`: The generated model file.
  * `pipeline.py`: The generated pipeline file.
  * `requirements.txt`: The generated requirements file.
  * `/encoders`: A folder containing JSON-serialized encoder files
  * `/metadata`: A folder containing training statistics + other cool stuff not yet implemented!
  * The model itself (format depends on framework)
* `automl_results.csv`: A CSV containing the training results after each epoch and the hyperparameters used to train at that time.

Once the training is done, you can run the generated files from the command line within the generated folder above.

To predict:

```shell
python3 model.py -d data.csv -m predict
```

To retrain the model on new data:

```shell
python3 model.py -d data.csv -m train
```

### With docker

Build the image:
```shell
docker build --tag automl_gs_docker_image .
```

Run `automl_gs` from a the docker container:
```shell
docker run -it --rm \
  -v $(pwd):/automl_gs_data/ \
  automl_gs_docker_image \
  automl_gs titanic.csv Survived
```

## CLI Arguments/Function Parameters

You can view these at any time by running `automl_gs -h` in the command line.

## Examples

For a quick Hello World on how to use automl-gs, see [this Jupyter Notebook](docs/automl_gs_tutorial.ipynb).

Due to the size of some examples w/ generated code and accompanying data visualizations, they are maintained in a [separate repository](https://github.com/minimaxir/automl-gs-examples). (and also explain why there are two distinct "levels" in the example viz above!)

## How automl-gs Works

TL;DR: auto-ml gs generates raw Python code using Jinja templates and trains a model using the generated code in a subprocess: repeat using different hyperparameters until done and save the best model.

automl-gs loads a given CSV and infers the data type of each column to be fed into the model. Then it tries a ETL strategy for each column field as determined by the hyperparameters; for example, a Datetime field has its `hour` and `dayofweek` binary-encoded by default, but hyperparameters may dictate the encoding of `month` and `year` as additional model fields. ETL strategies are optimized for frameworks; TensorFlow for example will use text embeddings, while other frameworks will use CountVectorizers to encode text (when training, TensorFlow will also used a shared text encoder via Keras's functional API). automl-gs then creates a statistical model with the specified framework. Both the model ETL functions and model construction functions are saved as a generated Python script.

automl-gs then runs the generated training script as if it was a typical user. Once the model is trained, automl-gs saves the training results in its own CSV, along with all the hyperparameters used to train the model. automl-gs then repeats the task with another set of hyperparameters, until the specified number of trials is hit or the user kills the script.

The best model Python script is kept after each trial, which can then easily be integrated into other scripts, or run directly to get the prediction results on a new dataset.

## Helpful Notes

* *It is the user's responsibility to ensure the input dataset is high-quality.* No model hyperparameter search will provide good research on flawed/unbalanced datasets. Relatedly, hyperparameter optimization may provide optimistic predictions on the validation set, which may not necessarily match the model performance in the real world.
* *A neural network approach alone may not necessarily be the best approach*. Try using `xgboost`. The results may surprise you!
* *automl-gs is only attempting to solve tabular data problems.* If you have a more complicated problem to solve (e.g. predicting a sequence of outputs), I recommend using Microsoft's [NNI](https://github.com/Microsoft/nni) and Uber's [Ludwig](https://github.com/uber/ludwig) as noted in the introduction.

## Known Issues
